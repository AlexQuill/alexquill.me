              <p>Deep Brain Stimulation is a relatively new neurosurgical technique that uses intracranially implanted electrodes to modulate abnormal brain activity with small electric impulses.</p>
              <p> I am currently working with Professor Roskies of the Dartmouth COGS department on an Obama-Administration four-year BRAIN Initiative Grant on the effects of DBS on patient agency.</p>
              <p> With the end goal of creating a significant DBS patient information database, we are currently developing a philosophically minded survey to administer patients before and after treatment, as well as implementing cognitive tasks such as the Stop Signal Task in Javascript and Python.</p>
