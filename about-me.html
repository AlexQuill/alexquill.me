            <p>Rock Climbing, specifically bouldering, is a passion I've had for nearly a decade. Bouldering routes, or "problems" as they are known for how hard it can be to unlock the right sequence of movement needed to solve them, are metrics I use to push myself and appreciate how far I've come. </p>
            <p>I've climbed in nearly all four corners of the country, from Mt. Rainier, Washington, to Joshua Tree, California, up to Mt. Rumney, New Hampshire. As a captain of the Dartmouth Climbing team, leading practices gives me a unique opportunity to share an activity that I care deeply about with people I love. </p>

            <p>Double H Ranch is a summer camp for children ages 6-21 with life threatening illness in Lake Luzerne, New York. I have been lucky enough to spend the past two summers as a full time staff member at Double H in the Muskrat, Deer, and Wolf Cabins.</p>
            <p>A normal day at Double H includes lots of regular camp stuff like swimming, archery, a fully accessible high ropes course, and some not so typical stuff, such as administering daily personal care routines. My summers at Double H have been the most impactful 20 weeks of my life, and have completely reshaped my hopes for my career.</p>
